In many languages, a variable binding would be called a variable, but Rustâ€™s variable bindings have a few tricks up their sleeves. For example the left-hand side of a let expression is a â€˜patternâ€™, not a variable name.

```rust
let (x, y) = (1, 2); // x will be one, and y will be two

let z: i32 = 5; // x is a integer from 32 bits

let mut k = 5; // by default are variables a immutable. So to allow mutability use mut
```
