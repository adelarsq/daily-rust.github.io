```rust
let x = 1;

match x {
    1 => println!("one"),
    2 => println!("two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

Thereâ€™s one pitfall with patterns: like anything that introduces a new binding, they introduce **shadowing**:

```rust
let x = 1;
let c = 'c';

match c {
    x => println!("x: {} c: {}", x, c), // here x is the c value and not the x variable
}

println!("x: {}", x)
```
