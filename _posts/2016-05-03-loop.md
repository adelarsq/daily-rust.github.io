### Structs

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
fn main() {
    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 }; // origin: Point
    println!("The origin is at ({}, {})", origin.x, origin.y);
}
```

### Update Syntax

A struct can include .. to indicate that you want to use a copy of some other struct for some of the values. For example:
```rust
struct Point3d {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
    z: i32,
}
let mut point = Point3d { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
point = Point3d { y: 1, .. point };
let origin = Point3d { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
let point2 = Point3d { z: 1, x: 2, .. origin };
```

### Tuple structs

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

### Unit-like structs

```rust
struct Electron;
let x = Electron;
```
