An enum in Rust is a type that represents data that is one of several possible variants. Each variant in the enum can optionally have data associated with it:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
}
```

We use the :: syntax to use the name of each variant: theyâ€™re scoped by the name of the enum itself.

```rust
let x: Message = Message::Move { x: 3, y: 4 };

enum BoardGameTurn {
    Move { squares: i32 },
    Pass,
}

let y: BoardGameTurn = BoardGameTurn::Move { squares: 1 };
```
