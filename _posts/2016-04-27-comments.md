Rust has two kinds of comments: line comments and doc comments.

Line comments are anything after // and extend to the end of the line. 

```rust
// this is a comment
let x = 5; // this is another comment
```

The other kind of comment is a doc comment. Doc comments use /// instead of //, and support [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) notation inside:

```rust
/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let five = 5;
///
/// assert_eq!(6, add_one(5));
/// # fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
/// #     x + 1
/// # }
/// ```
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

There is another style of doc comment, //!, to comment containing items. Commonly used inside crates root (lib.rs) or modules root (mod.rs):

```rust
//! # The Rust Standard Library
//!
//! The Rust Standard Library provides the essential runtime
//! functionality for building portable Rust software.
```
