Values are binded to names with ```@```:

```rust
let x = 3;

match x {
    e @ 1 ... 5 => println!("got a range element {}", e),
    e @ 6 ... 10 => println!("got a range element {}", e),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

This prints got a range element 1. This is useful when you want to do a complicated match of part of a data structure:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: Option<String>,
}

let name = "Steve".to_string();
let x: Option<Person> = Some(Person { name: Some(name) });
match x {
    Some(Person { name: ref a @ Some(_), .. }) => println!("{:?}", a),
    _ => {}
}
```

If you use ```@``` with ```|```, you need to make sure the name is bound in each part of the pattern:

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    e @ 1 ... 5 | e @ 8 ... 10 => println!("got a range element {}", e),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```
