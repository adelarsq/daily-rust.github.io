On this blog I will talk about the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org) and related stuff.

Actually I work as a Java Senior Developer and System Analyst. I have work experience with many stuff, since assembly until Web development.

I don't have so much time, but I will try to post daily here. ðŸ˜‰

Any contribution will be welcome! ðŸ˜Š
