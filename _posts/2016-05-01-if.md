Just one choise:

```rust
let x = 5;
if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
}
```

One choise or another:

```rust
let x = 5;
if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
} else {
    println!("x is not five :(");
}
```

Many choises:

```rust
let x = 5;
if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
} else if x == 6 {
    println!("x is six!");
} else {
    println!("x is not five or six :(");
}
```

You can do something like:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = if x == 5 {
    10
} else {
    15
}; // y: i32
```

Or better:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = if x == 5 { 10 } else { 15 }; // y: i32
```
